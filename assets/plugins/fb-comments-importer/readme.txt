Import Facebook comments into Wordpress database.

== Description ==

Facebook comments importer is used to import comments from Facebook pages, groups and user profiles directly in the Wordpress database. 
Apart from just importing the comments, our plugin will also pull and display profile pictures as avatars and every comment will have the 
real authors name to it. The comments are displayed in the same format as they appear on Facebook, which means that nested comments are 
fully supported and the plugin will also show replies to comments made by users. The main advantage of importing comments into the Wordpress 
database is the fact that they become visible to search engines and this procedure has a positive effect on your websites SEO. Besides that, 
your website will look much more active and also encourage other users to get involved in discussions.


We also have a **PRO** version with additional features:

* Import comments from regular posts, videos, images or statuses
* Import from pages, groups or profiles
* Manually connect post with comments
* Importing comments from very old posts, no limits
* Automate the import process (with WP cron)
* Turn the cron on/off or restart it
* Modification of the main URL (useful in cases of changing the domain)
* Faster and more efficient support

The free version offers just basic functionality, like the manual import of comments from a Facebook group or page if the post was published 
as a link to some of the articles on your website. 

The PRO version has **no limitations**, it is possible to import comments from almost everything, like from pictures, videos, links through to 
ordinary text statuses. The PRO version will in various ways automatically try to connect Facebook posts with some of the articles on your 
website. Furthermore, the PRO version is doing everything automatically, so there is no need for manual comment importing, the plugin will 
automatically start importing comments every 10 minutes and do everything on itâ€™s own. Besides that, you will also have the possibility of 
importing comments from two different Facebook groups or pages + the import from your user wall.

For any issues with the plugin, please open a support ticket and we will fix it ASAP!

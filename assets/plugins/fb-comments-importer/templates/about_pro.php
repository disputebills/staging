                    <p>
                        As I’m sure you already know, Facebook comments importer is used to import comments from 
                        Facebook pages, groups and user profiles directly in the Wordpress database. Apart from just 
                        showing the comments, our plugin will also pull and display profile pictures as avatars and every 
                        comment will have the real authors name to it. The comments are displayed in the same format 
                        as they appear on Facebook, which means that nested comments are fully supported and the 
                        plugin will also show responds to comments made by users. The main advantage of importing 
                        comments into the Wordpress database is the fact that they become visible to search engines and 
                        this procedure has a positive effect on your websites SEO. Besides that, your website will look
                        much more active and also encourage other users to get involved in discussions.

                    <h2>Why you should upgrade to the PRO version?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The answer is actually very simple – because the PRO version of the Facebook comments importer 
                        is far more powerful and flexible than the available free version. The free version offers just basic 
                        functionality, like the manual import of comments from a Facebook group or page if the post was 
                        published as a link to some of the articles on your website. 
                        <br><br>
                        The PRO version has no limitations, it is possible to import comments from almost everything, 
                        like from pictures, videos, links through to ordinary text statuses. The PRO version will in various 
                        ways automatically try to connect Facebook posts with some of the articles on your website. 
                        Furthermore, the PRO version is doing everything automatically, so there is no need for manual 
                        comment importing, the plugin will automatically start importing comments every 10 minutes and 
                        do everything on it’s own. Besides that, you will also have the possibility of importing comments 
                        from two different Facebook groups or pages + the import from your user wall. Still not enough?

                    <p>
                        We provide support to all users, no matter if you use the PRO or free version. That said, the support
                        for the PRO version is faster and more efficient, but we are also ready to make minor modifications 
                        to the plugin for the user. Besides that, users of the PRO version also have the option of getting a 
                        free installation and configuration of the plugin (if you struggle with the setup on your own). We will also listen to 
                        your suggestions and requests for new features, from which the best will be implemented in a short time.
                        <br><br>

                    <h2>Single license or developer?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The only difference between these two versions is the number of domains on which it is possible
                        to install the plugin. In the case of a single domain license, the plugin can be installed only once 
                        on only one domain. Your license key can unlock only one installation. The key for a developer 
                        version allows you to install the plugin on up to 30 domains! The developer license is a perfect 
                        choice for webmasters with multiple websites, because for just a slightly higher price they will get 
                        30 times more installations.

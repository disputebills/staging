Lists all ACF variables of added field groups so you can simply copy-and-paste into your theme template. Supports ACF PRO!

== Description == 

Finally being able to copy all ACF field group variables is here!!!

**Now Supports ACF PRO!**

This plugin was build for the awesomeness of the [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/ "Advanced custom fields | ACF") plugin created by Elliot Condon, so that referencing custom fields is fast and makes life easier for developers. 

You are now able to get a complete list of fields that you've created, make adjustments with the available options, and simply copy-and-paste them right into your theme template. No more switching back-and-forth screens in order to copy-and-paste field names into your file. whew!

I hope you enjoy this plugin and if it works for you, please add your rating. Your donations to (https://PayPal.Me/samjco) will help to make this plugin better!
